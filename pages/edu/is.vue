      The Income Statement, often referred to as the Statement of Operations, shows a company’s performance (revenue and expenses) in a set period of time on an accrual basis. This differs from what would seem like the more straightforward cash basis that would realize revenue or expenses as they are incurred. In order to follow the accrual method, there are 2 primary principles to follow:

Revenue recognition: company can only actually recognize revenue when a specific event has occurred such as the actual delivery of goods and services. 
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p align=center style="padding-top:5vh">
Please note there is a difference between when you recognize revenue vs when the company is actually paid for its goods and services. Many times, things are paid for with credit, so revenue is recognized now but the company receives the cash payment later.

Expense matching: Companies must only report an expense on their Income Statement in the period in which the related revenue is recognized. 

Following these basic principles, we can have a better understanding of what makes the Income Statement unique. Below, each line item will be explained.

   <h5 style="text-align:center;padding-top:5vh">  Income Statement  </h5> 

<p style="padding-top:5vh">
  <ul style="align:left">
    <li>
Revenue: The amount of money received from the sale of products or services before taking into account any expenses. It is referred to as the “top line” and can also be called “Sales”. Occasionally, it is referred to as “net sales” to take into account items that are not expenses and reduce revenue such as returns, discounts, and allowances. 
</li>
<li style="padding-top:2vh">
Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): The direct costs of the product or service sold by the business, which can include items such as direct manufacturing labor, costs of materials for the product, and manufacturing overhead. 
</li>
<li style="padding-top:2vh">
Gross Profit: Calculated as Revenue minus COGS. Can also be referred to as gross margin. 
</li>
<li style="padding-top:2vh">
Sales & Marketing (S&M): These are costs that a company incurs as it tries to grow its revenue. It may include selling commissions, advertisements, public relation campaigns, etc.
</li>
<li style="padding-top:2vh">
General & Administrative (G&A): These are costs incurred by the company unrelated to its core business model, but still necessary for a company to exist. It may include legal costs, human resources costs, accounting & finance costs, etc.  
</li>
<li style="padding-top:2vh">
Research & Development (R&D): R&D expenses are related to the direct investments a company makes to develop new products or intellectual property that give it a competitive advantage over others. Companies are usually highly secretive about what they spend their R&D budget on, and it is a primary factor for a company’s long-term growth and success.
</li>
<li style="padding-top:2vh">
Depreciation & Amortization (D&A): These are non-cash expenses that reflect a reduction in long-term assets such as PP&E or Intangibles. For example, when a company buys a building for one million dollars, it expects to use the building for several years. Rather than recognizing the entire cost of the building in just the first year, it spreads out the costs of obtaining this building over time. So, if a company were to purchase this million-dollar building, and expected to use it for ten years, it would recognize an annual depreciation of $100,000. Amortization reflects this same concept but for intangible assets like patents or trademarks. 
</li>
**Please note, not all Income Statements are formatted the same and some may include various combinations of the above-mentioned expenses, or not have them on the Income Statement. For example, a company could have one line item be Sales, General, & Administrative. COGS and Revenue, however, will never be entangled with these other expenses. 
<li style="padding-top:2vh">
Operating Income/profit (EBIT): This can be referred to as EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes). EBIT can be a strong indicator of a company’s true profitability. 
</li>
<li style="padding-top:2vh">
Interest expense: This reflects the costs associated with a loan or some other form of debt the company owes.
</li>
<li style="padding-top:2vh">
Interest income: This reflects additional income generated from a financial investment made by the company. For example, if a company invested in a bond with its extra cash, it could receive interest income from that bond. 
</li>
<li style="padding-top:2vh">
Income before taxes: EBIT minus interest expense + interest income
</li>
<li style="padding-top:2vh">
Tax expense: Effective corporate tax rate X income before taxes
</li>
<li style="padding-top:2vh">
Net income: Income before taxes – tax expense. This can also be referred to as the “bottom-line”. It shows the total income a company generates after all of its expenses. It links to the Balance sheet by increasing both equity and assets an equal amount (see balance sheet page for more info). 
</li>
</ul>

 <h5 style="text-align:center"> Bank Income Statement  </h5> 


  <p style="padding-top:5vh;text-align:center">
  As opposed to regular business entities, banks will have much different income statements. Banks earn their income by taking deposits from consumers and businesses, pay a small interest on those deposits, and either invest a part of that money or lend it to other consumers or companies. Banks receive an interest on these loans or their investments that is higher than the interest they pay depositors. Banks also pay deposit insurance on the cash they lend and reinvest, so if it ever goes bankrupt the FDIC will cover every deposit for up to $200,000 per individual. 
 </p>
 <ul style="padding-top:5vh">
<li>
Interest Income: as opposed to revenue, a bank will have interest income as their “top-line” which can include loans, leases, debt securities, federal funds sold and borrowed, trading account assets, or other interest income. 
</li>

<li style="padding-top:2vh">
  Interest expense: This can reflect expenses such as interest it pays to depositors, short-term borrowings, long-term debt, and trading account liabilities. 
</li>

<li style="padding-top:2vh">
Net interest margin (NIM): Interest income – interest expense 

<li style="padding-top:2vh">
Noninterest income: This reflects income generated from other activities such as service charges, mortgage income, income from other divisions such as an investment banking division, income from brokerage services, and other forms of income. 
</li>

<li style="padding-top:2vh">
Core revenue: Net interest margin + noninterest income
</li>

<li style="padding-top:2vh">
Noninterest expense: This reflects other expenses such as staff, equipment, professional fees, marketing costs, data processing costs, and other items.
