The cash flow statement acts as a compliment to the income statement and balance sheet by showing the actual amount of cash that flowed in and out of the company in a certain period of time. 
</p>
<p style="text-align:left;padding-top:2vh">
  It is separated into 3 separate sections:
<ol style="padding-top:2vh">
<li>
  cash flow from operating activities (CFO)
</li>

<li>
  cash flow from investing activities (CFI)
</li>

<li>
  cash flow from financing activities (CFF)
</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p style="padding-top:2">
CFO shows sources and uses of cash for general business activities like buying materials and selling products. It can be displayed through either the indirect or direct method. 
</p>

<p style="padding-top:2">
CFI shows sources and uses of cash for investing activities like buying buildings or new equipment. 
</p>

<p style="padding-top:2">
CFF shows sources and uses of cash from and to investors and banks such as loans or share purchases.  
</p>

<p style="padding-top:2">
Cash flow from operations (direct method) = cash received from customers – cash paid to suppliers – salaries paid to employees + interest income received – interest and taxes paid
</p>

<p style="padding-top:2">
Cash flow from operations (indirect method) = net income + depreciation & amortization + stock-based compensation – increase in current assets (such as inventory or A/R) + increase in current liabilities (such as A/P or unearned revenue) + interest income received – interest and taxes paid
</p>

<p style="padding-top:2">
*non-cash expenses such as D&A and stock-based compensation are added back because they reduced net income but do not involve the company spending any actual cash. Increases in current assets like A/R decrease cash flow because it reflects an increase in a source of cash that has not actually been realized yet. When current liabilities increase, this reflects cash the company owes but still has not given away yet. 
</p>

<p style="padding-top:2">
Cash flow from investing activities= sale of PP&E assets + sale of intangible assets – capital expenditures – purchase of investment securities such as stocks– money lent out + sale of investment securities + collection of loans and insurance proceeds
</p>

<p style="padding-top:2">
*Capital expenditures reflects the amount of money a company is investing in itself to grow operations and increases PP&E. 
</p>

<p style="padding-top:2;padding-bottom:10vh">
Cash flow from financing activities= cash inflow from issuing equity + cash inflow from issuing debt – cash paid as dividends – repurchase of equity – repayment of loan principal.
