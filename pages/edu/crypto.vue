Cryptocurrencies are rapidly becoming more popular as both a medium of exchange and a new asset class for investing. As oppose to a central banking controlling it, a public ledger is distributed, and the public regulates it. They promise greater security, lower transaction fees, and a volatile investment with low correlations to other assets with huge upside and downside potential returns.

Cryptocurrency has the potential to remove financial institutions as the intermediary between a buyer and a seller. While there is usually a 2-3 day processing time traditionally though an automated clearing house, bitcoin transactions take 10 minutes to settle at no cost, regardless ff the transaction size or distance between the buyer and seller. 
The nature of blockchain makes it impenetrable to altering transaction data and prevents fraudulent money theft. 
Initial Coin Offerings, similarly to IPOs, also offer a new form of raising capital without the complex and expensive traditional fundraising process in the public markets.
